## Description

### Goal

Please describe the PR goals with a simple description of the issue.  Just the stuff needed to implement the fix / feature and a simple rationale strategy. It could contain many check points as following:

- [x] I have fixed [#issue](link) or I have done some steps
- [ ] Some steps will be done

### Implementation

Please include all the relevant things implemented and also rationale, clarifications / disclaimers etc. related to the approach used. It could be as self code companion comments

## Testing with Screenshots or Gifs

Please describe the manual tests steps that you ran to verify your changes. 

 1.
 2.
 3.

 Please include all the media files to give some context about what's being implemented or fixed. It's not mandatory to upload screenshots or gifs, but for most of the cases it becomes really handy to get into the scope of the feature / bug being fixed and also it's REALLY useful for UI related PRs ![screenshot gif](link)
